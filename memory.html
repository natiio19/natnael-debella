<h2 style="font-size: 35px;"><big> Memory</big></h2>
<p> 
<ul style="font-size: 30px;">
<li>Memory, in the context of computers, refers to the electronic component that stores data and instructions for the CPU to access and use when needed. It's like the brain of the computer, where information is temporarily stored and retrieved during operations.</li></br>
<li>It is a data storage device or a data storage component where instructions for processing data are kept along with the data that has to be processed.</li></br>
<li>Both the input and the output can be held here.</li></br>
<li>The computer memory is divided into large number of small parts
known as cells.</li></br>
<li>Each cell has a unique address which varies from 0 to memory size minus one.</li></br>
</ul>
</br>

<p style="font-size: 30px"><big>Types of computer Memory</big></p>
<ol type="I"> 

<li style="font-size: 25px;">Primary Memory</li>
</br>

<ol type="i" style="font-size: 30px;">  
<li style="font-size: 30px">Random Access Memory (RAM) RAM is the primary memory used by the computer's CPU to store data and instructions that are actively being used or processed. It is volatile memory, meaning it loses its contents when the power is turned off. RAM is essential for multitasking and overall system performance.</li></br>

<ul style="font-size: 30px;">
<li>It allows CPU store data, program, and program results when you switch on the computer.</li></br>
<li>It is the read and write memory of a computer, which means the information can be written to it as well as read from it.</li></br>
<li>It is the main memory of a computer.</li></br>
<li>It is faster to write to and read from as compared to other memories such as a hard disk drive (HDD), solid-state drive (SSD), optical drive, etc.</li>
</ul>
</br>

Function of RAM
<ul>
</br>
<li>RAM has no potential for storing permanent data due to its volatility.</li></br>
<li>RAM is used to store information that needs to be used quickly.</li></br>
<li>RAM is used for immediate data storage and retrieval â€” any task that requires quick access to computing resources. Another use for RAM is to help your computer load previously-accessed information more quickly.</li></br>
</ul>

Types of RAM
<ol>
</br>
<li>Dynamic RAM (DRAM)</li></br>

Dynamic Random Access Memory (DRAM) is a type of memory commonly used as the main memory in computers and other electronic devices. It is called "dynamic" because it needs to be constantly refreshed to maintain the data stored in it. DRAM stores each bit of data as an electric charge in a tiny capacitor within an integrated circuit. However, over time, due to the leakage of charge, the data stored in DRAM cells gradually fades away. Therefore, DRAM requires periodic refresh cycles, where the memory controller reads and rewrites the data to maintain its integrity.
</br>

<li>Static RAM (SRAM)</li></br>
Static Random Access Memory (SRAM) is another type of semiconductor memory commonly used in computer systems and other electronic devices. Unlike Dynamic RAM (DRAM), SRAM does not require constant refreshing to maintain the data stored in it. Instead, SRAM uses a combination of transistors to create flip-flops, which can store data as long as power is supplied to the memory.
</ol>
</br>
<li>Read-Only Memory (ROM) ROM is non-volatile memory that stores firmware or essential software instructions that are permanently written during manufacturing. It retains its contents even when the power is turned off. ROM is used to store the computer's BIOS (Basic Input/Output System) and other critical firmware.</li></br>

<big>Types of Read-Only Memory</big>

<ol>
</br>
<li>Mask ROM (MROM): Mask ROM is a type of ROM where the data is programmed during the manufacturing process using a mask. The data is permanently encoded onto the ROM chip's silicon, and once programmed, it cannot be changed. Mask ROMs are commonly used for storing firmware and essential system software in devices like game consoles, appliances, and automotive electronics.</li></br>

<li>Programmable ROM (PROM): Programmable ROM allows users to write data to the memory after the chip has been manufactured. PROM chips are initially blank, and users can program them using a special device called a PROM programmer. Once programmed, the data is permanent and cannot be changed. PROMs are often used for small production runs or for applications where the data doesn't need frequent updates.</li></br>

<li>Erasable Programmable ROM (EPROM): EPROM is similar to PROM, but it allows for the data to be erased and reprogrammed multiple times. EPROM chips are programmed using a PROM programmer, but they can be erased by exposing the chip to ultraviolet (UV) light for a specified duration. Once erased, the chip can be reprogrammed with new data. EPROMs were widely used in early computer systems and embedded devices but have largely been replaced by EEPROM and flash memory due to their erasure method being less convenient.</li></br>

<li>Electrically Erasable Programmable ROM (EEPROM or E2PROM): EEPROM is a type of ROM that can be electrically erased and reprogrammed. Unlike EPROM, which requires exposure to UV light for erasure, EEPROM can be erased and reprogrammed in-circuit using electrical signals. This makes EEPROM more convenient for use in devices where frequent updates to the stored data are necessary, such as BIOS chips, firmware storage in embedded systems, and memory cards.</li></br>
</ol>

<li>Cache Memory: Cache memory is a small, high-speed memory located on or near the CPU chip. Its purpose is to temporarily store frequently accessed data and instructions to speed up processing. There are different levels of cache memory, including L1, L2, and L3 cache, with varying sizes and speeds.</li></br>
</ol>

<li style="font-size: 30px;"><big>Secondary Memory</big></li>
</ol>

</br>
<p style="font-size: 30px;">Secondary memory, also known as auxiliary memory or external memory, refers to storage devices that store data and programs permanently, even when the power is turned off. Unlike primary memory (RAM), which is volatile and temporary, secondary memory retains data for long-term storage and retrieval.</p>

</br>
<big style="font-size: 30px;">characteristics of secondary memory</big>
<ul style="font-size: 30px;">
<li>Non-Volatile: Secondary memory is non-volatile, meaning it retains data even when the power is turned off. This makes it suitable for long-term storage of files, documents, programs, and other data.</li></br>

<li>Large Storage Capacity: Secondary memory devices typically offer larger storage capacities compared to primary memory (RAM). This allows users to store large amounts of data, including multimedia files, software applications, and operating systems.</li></br>

<li>Slower Access Speed: Secondary memory usually has slower access speeds compared to primary memory. Accessing data from secondary storage devices involves mechanical movements (in the case of hard disk drives) or electrical operations (in the case of solid-state drives), which are slower than accessing data from RAM.</li></br>

<li>Persistent Storage: Data stored in secondary memory remains intact even after the computer is turned off or restarted. This persistence makes secondary memory essential for storing data that needs to be preserved for future use.</li></br>

</ul>
<big style="font-size: 30px;">Examples of secondary memory devices include:</big>
<ul style="font-size: 30px;">
<li>Hard Disk Drives (HDDs): HDDs use rotating magnetic disks to store data. They offer high capacities and are commonly used in desktop computers, laptops, and servers for long-term storage.</li></br>

<li>Solid-State Drives (SSDs): SSDs use flash memory to store data, offering faster access speeds and better durability compared to HDDs. SSDs are commonly used in laptops, desktops, and data centers for both primary and secondary storage.</li></br>

<li>External Hard Drives: These are portable storage devices that connect to computers via USB or other interfaces. They offer additional storage capacity and can be used for backup, file transfer, and expanding storage capacity.</li></br>

<li>USB Flash Drives: USB flash drives are small, portable storage devices that connect to computers via USB ports. They are commonly used for transferring files between computers and as a portable storage solution.</li></br>

<li>Memory Cards: Memory cards are used in digital cameras, smartphones, tablets, and other devices to store photos, videos, and other data. They offer removable storage and are available in various formats such as SD, microSD, and CompactFlash.</li></br>
