    <ul>
        <li>Hardware refers to the physical components of a computer system or any electronic device. It encompasses all the tangible parts that you can touch and see, such as the central processing unit (CPU), memory (RAM), hard drives, graphics cards, motherboards, keyboards, monitors, mice, and other peripherals. Hardware components work together to execute instructions and perform tasks as directed by software programs. They are essential for the functioning of computers and electronic devices.</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <ol type="I"> 
        
        <li> Central Processing Unit (CPU)</li>
        
        <ul type="circle"> 
        </br>
        <li>The CPU, also known as the processor, is the
        "brain" of the computer. It performs arithmetic, logical, control, and input/output operations specified by the instructions of the software.</li></br>
        </ul>
        
        <li>Memory
        <ul type="circle"> 
        </br>
        <li>Memory, or RAM (Random Access Memory)
        stores data and instructions that the CPU needs to access quickly during program execution. RAM is volatile, meaning it loses its contents when the computer is turned off.</li></br>
        
        <li>ROM (Read-Only Memory) stores firmware and permanent instructions used during the boot process. Unlike RAM, ROM retains its contents even when the power is off.

        <ul type="circle"> 
        
        <li> Hard Disk Drives (HDDs) and Solid-State Drives
        (SSDs) provide non-volatile storage for data and
        programs. They store files, documents, applications, and the operating system.</li></br>
        
        <li>Optical drives, such as CD/DVD drives, allow for reading and writing data to optical discs.</li></br>
        
        <li>Flash drives, SD cards, and other removable storage devices provide portable storage solutions.</li>

        connects and houses many of the computer's essential components, including the CPU, memory modules, expansion cards, and connectors for input/output devices.</li>

        <li>Expansion Cards</li>
        <ul type="circle"> 
        </br>
        <li>Expansion cards, also known as adapter cards or interface cards, add extra functionality to a computer system. Examples include graphics cards (for enhanced video performance), sound cards (for audio output), and network interface cards (for connecting to networks).</li>

    <ul>
    <li>Software refers to a collection of programs, data, and instructions that enable a computer system to perform specific tasks or functions. It encompasses a wide range of applications, from operating systems and drivers that manage hardware components to productivity software like word processors and spreadsheets, entertainment software such as games and media players, and specialized tools for various industries like engineering, healthcare, and finance.</li>
    </ul>
    </br>
    Software can be categorized into two main types:</br>
    <ol>
    <li>System Software: This type of software manages and controls the hardware components of a computer system and provides a platform for running application software. Examples include operating systems (e.g., Windows, macOS, Linux), device drivers, utilities, and firmware.</li></br>
    
    <ol type="I">  
    <li>Operating Systems (OS): The most fundamental type of system software, an operating system manages hardware resources, provides essential services to applications, and facilitates communication between hardware and software components. Examples include Windows, macOS, Linux, and iOS.</li></br>
    <img src="img1/hqdefault.jpg">
    <li>Device Drivers: These software components allow the operating system to communicate with hardware devices such as printers, graphics cards, and network adapters.</li></br>
    <img src="img1/device.png">
    <li>Utility Programs: Utilities perform tasks like disk management, system maintenance, data backup, and antivirus protection. Examples
    include disk cleanup tools, file compression programs, and firewall software.</li></br>
    <img src="img1/Utility-Software_inside.png" width="600px">
    </ol>
    </br>
    
    <li><big>Application Software</li></big>
    </ul>
    <img src=“(4).png”>
    </br>
    Application software consists of programs
    designed to perform specific tasks or provide services to end-users.
    
    <ol type="I"> 
    </br>
    <li>Productivity Software: These applications help users create, edit, manage, and share documents, spreadsheets, presentations, and other types of content. Examples include word processors (Microsoft Word), spreadsheet programs (Microsoft Excel), and presentation software (Microsoft PowerPoint).</li></br>
    <li>Multimedia Software: Multimedia applications allow users to create, edit, and consume various forms of digital media, including audio, video, and images. Examples include media players, video editors, and graphic design software.</li></br>
    <li>Business Software: Business applications help organizations manage their operations, finances, customer relationships, and resources. Examples include enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems, customer relationship management (CRM) software, and accounting applications.</li></br>
    <li>Entertainment Software: Entertainment software provides users with leisure and recreational experiences, including video games, virtual reality (VR) experiences, and streaming media services.</li></br>
    <li>Educational Software: Educational applications are designed to facilitate learning and skill development in academic and professional settings. Examples include interactive tutorials, simulation software, and language learning programs.</li></br>
